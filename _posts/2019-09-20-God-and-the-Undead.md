<blockquote><p align="center">In the Age of Ancients,
The world was unformed, shrouded by fog.
A land of grey crags, archtrees, and everlasting dragons.<br>
But then there was Fire
And with Fire came Disparity. Heat and cold, life and death, and of course.. Light and Dark.  <br>
Then, from the Dark, They came.
And found the Souls of Lords within the flame.  <br>
Nito, the first of the dead.
The Witch of Izalith, and her daughters of chaos.
Gwyn, the Lord of Sunlight, and his faithful knights.
And the furtive pygmy, so easily forgotten...  <br>
With the Strength of Lords, they challenged the dragons.  <br>
Gwyn's mighty bolts peeled apart their stone scales.
The witches weaved great firestorms.
Nito unleashed a miasma of death and disease.  <br>
And Seath the Scaleless betrayed his own, and the dragons were no more.
Thus began the Age of Fire.  <br>
But soon, the flames will fade, and only Dark will remain.  <br>
Even now, there are only embers, and man sees not light, but only endless nights.
And amongst the living are seen, carriers of the accursed Darksign.</p>

上面是黑暗之魂初代开场CG动画里面的台词。这段话对黑魂世界所处的世界给出了一些描述。（实际上，这也是整个游戏里面唯一对世界观进行直接说明的文本。）
世界上有古龙，是不朽的存在和力量的化身。初火孕育了诸神，并与古龙发生了战争。葛温战胜统治世界的古龙，建立火之时代。我们至少会注意到三个比较关键的元素：古龙，初火，诸神。
